  <summary>Type declaration</summary>

```tsx
declare function Link(props: LinkProps): React.ReactElement;

interface LinkProps
  extends Omit<
    React.AnchorHTMLAttributes<HTMLAnchorElement>,
    "href"
  > {
  replace?: boolean;
  state?: any;
  to: To;
  reloadDocument?: boolean;
}

type To = string | Partial<Path>;
```

A `<Link>` is an element that lets the user navigate to another page by clicking or tapping on it. In `react-router-dom`, a `<Link>` renders an accessible `<a>` element with a real `href` that points to the resource it's linking to. This means that things like right-clicking a `<Link>` work as you'd expect. You can use `<Link reloadDocument>` to skip client side routing and let the browser handle the transition normally (as if it were an `<a href>`).

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function UsersIndexPage({ users }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Users</h1>
      <ul>
        {users.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>
            <Link to={user.id}>{user.name}</Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

A relative `<Link to>` value (that does not begin with `/`) resolves relative to the parent route, which means that it builds upon the URL path that was matched by the route that rendered that `<Link>`. It may contain `..` to link to routes further up the hierarchy. In these cases, `..` works exactly like the command-line `cd` function; each `..` removes one segment of the parent path.

> **Note:**
>
> `<Link to>` with a `..` behaves differently from a normal `<a href>` when the
> current URL ends with `/`. `<Link to>` ignores the trailing slash, and removes
> one URL segment for each `..`. But an `<a href>` value handles `..`
> differently when the current URL ends with `/` vs when it does not.
