# Route APIs

Because the API and use cases for `<Route />` includes data loading, mutations, and more, `<Route>` has its own documentation category.

Please refer to:

- [`<Route>`][route]
- [`loader`][loader]
- [`action`][action]
- [`errorElement`][errorelement]
- [`shouldRevalidate`][shouldrevalidate]

[route]: ../route/route
[loader]: ../route/loader
[action]: ../route/action
[errorelement]: ../route/error-element
[shouldrevalidate]: ../route/should-revalidate
