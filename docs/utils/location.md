# `Location`

The term "location" in React Router refers to [the `Location` interface](https://github.com/remix-run/history/blob/main/docs/api-reference.md#location) from the [history](https://github.com/remix-run/history) library.

> **Note:**
>
> The `history` package is React Router's only dependency and many of the
> core types in React Router come directly from that library including
> `Location`, `To`, `Path`, and others. You can read more about
> the history library in [its documentation](https://github.com/remix-run/history/tree/main/docs).
